# Agent Workflows

## First-Class Agents

Custom Copilot agents are first-class product artifacts. Copilot Architect generates, validates, installs, updates, and diagnoses agent definitions that are grounded in the current repo or workspace. All agents use the `gpt-4o` model.

---

## Installing Agents

```bash
npm run cli -- agents install
```

This installs the following files under `.github/agents/` by default:

| File | Agent Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FeatureArchitect.agent.md` | `@FeatureArchitect` | Analyze repo, find patterns, produce implementation plans — no code edits |
| `FeatureImplementer.agent.md` | `@FeatureImplementer` | Implement an approved plan with minimal scoped changes and tests |
| `CodeReviewer.agent.md` | `@CodeReviewer` | Review diff against approved plan and validation evidence |
| `TestPlanner.agent.md` | `@TestPlanner` | Map features to test coverage strategies |
| `Debugger.agent.md` | `@Debugger` | Classify validation failures and propose minimal safe fixes |
| `SecurityReviewer.agent.md` | `@SecurityReviewer` | Review changes for security risks |
| `PerformanceReviewer.agent.md` | `@PerformanceReviewer` | Identify performance concerns |

Each agent file includes:
- YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `model: gpt-4o`, and `tools`
- `## Purpose` — what the agent is allowed and not allowed to do
- `## Instructions` — ordered steps the agent follows
- `## Handoff Guidance` — how to pass context to the next agent
- `## Safety Rules` — explicit constraints (no unauthorized edits, no secrets, etc.)
- `## Copilot Architect Artifacts` — paths to `.copilot-architect/` artifacts the agent should read

## Agent Commands

```bash
npm run cli -- agents list
npm run cli -- agents install
npm run cli -- agents install --dry-run          # preview without writing
npm run cli -- agents install --force            # overwrite existing files (backs up first)
npm run cli -- agents install --output <dir>     # install to a custom directory
npm run cli -- agents update                     # update installed agents (backs up first)
npm run cli -- agents validate                   # validate installed agent files
npm run cli -- agents doctor                     # explain how to use @FeatureArchitect etc.
```

Use `--output json` or `--json` for structured output.

Existing files are **skipped by default**. `--force` and `agents update` overwrite generated files only after creating `.bak` backups.

## Primary Workflow

### Step-by-step

1. **Analyze** the repo or workspace:
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- analyze
   npm run cli -- index
   ```

2. **Generate a feature plan** using `@FeatureArchitect` or directly from CLI:
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- plan "Add invoice approval workflow"
   # writes .copilot-architect/plans/latest-plan.md
   ```
   In Copilot Chat:
   ```text
   @FeatureArchitect Analyze this repo and produce a plan for adding invoice approval.
   Do not edit any code yet.
   ```

3. **Review and approve** the plan (human checkpoint).

4. **Generate a handoff**:
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- handoff --plan latest --approve
   # writes .copilot-architect/handoffs/latest-handoff.md, copies to clipboard
   ```

5. **Implement** using `@FeatureImplementer`:
   ```text
   @FeatureImplementer Implement .copilot-architect/handoffs/latest-handoff.md.
   Run validation commands and summarize changed files.
   ```

6. **Validate**:
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- validate --test
   npm run cli -- validate --lint
   ```

7. **Review** the implementation:
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- review --plan latest --validation latest
   # writes .copilot-architect/reviews/latest-review.md
   ```
   In Copilot Chat:
   ```text
   @CodeReviewer Review the git diff against .copilot-architect/reviews/latest-review.md
   and the approved plan.
   ```

8. **Debug failures** if validation failed:
   ```text
   @Debugger Validation failed. Use .copilot-architect/runs/latest-validation.json
   to classify the failure and propose the smallest safe fix.
   ```

---

## Agent Handoff Chain

Agents include built-in Copilot Chat handoff buttons:

```
@FeatureArchitect → @FeatureImplementer
@FeatureImplementer → @CodeReviewer
@CodeReviewer → @Debugger (when validation failed)
```

---

## Copilot Chat MCP Integration

Copilot Architect writes `.vscode/mcp.json` for VS Code and GitHub Copilot Chat:

```bash
npm run cli -- mcp config --path /path/to/repo
```

The generated server is named `copilotArchitect` and runs the local stdio MCP server. To connect:

1. Open VS Code Command Palette → `MCP: List Servers`
2. Start `copilotArchitect`
3. Open Copilot Chat in Agent mode
4. Enable Copilot Architect tools when prompted

Copilot Architect does not modify Copilot internals. It provides supported repository customization files and a local MCP server configuration.

---

## Instructions and Skills

Copilot Architect generates `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and skill templates from the same repo intelligence used by the planner:

```bash
npm run cli -- instructions preview    # preview without writing
npm run cli -- instructions generate   # write files (backs up existing)
npm run cli -- instructions validate   # validate generated files
```

Generated instructions include: repo architecture summary, detected languages, frameworks, package managers, build/test/lint/format commands, coding conventions, safety rules, planning workflow, approval workflow, validation workflow, and review workflow.

**Generated skills:**
- `.github/skills/feature-planning/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/repo-analysis/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/validation/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/debugging/SKILL.md`

**Generated Copilot Chat prompt files:**
- `.github/prompts/copilot-architect-plan.prompt.md`
- `.github/prompts/copilot-architect-implement.prompt.md`
- `.github/prompts/copilot-architect-review.prompt.md`
- `.github/prompts/copilot-architect-debug.prompt.md`

---

## Example Copilot Chat Prompts

**Planning a feature:**
```text
@FeatureArchitect Add [feature] based on this repo.
Use Copilot Architect repo map, index, MCP tools, and latest generated plan.
Do not modify code yet. First create a detailed implementation plan.
```

**After approval:**
```text
@FeatureImplementer Implement the approved plan from .copilot-architect/plans/latest-plan.md.
Run validation commands and summarize changed files.
```

**After implementation:**
```text
@CodeReviewer Review the git diff against the approved plan and latest validation report.
```

**If validation failed:**
```text
@Debugger Validation failed. Use .copilot-architect/runs/latest-validation.json
and related logs to classify the failure and propose the smallest safe fix.
```

**Security review:**
```text
@SecurityReviewer Review the changes in the git diff for security risks.
Reference .copilot-architect/plans/latest-plan.md for expected scope.
```

## UI Boundary

Any agent workflow exposed in VS Code or the local web UI must call the agents and instructions packages. UI shells must not implement agent generation logic directly.
