# MCP Tools

## Role

MCP is a first-class integration path. The local MCP server exposes Copilot Architect repo intelligence to agent hosts — including GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent mode — without forcing those hosts to parse CLI text output.

---

## Starting the MCP Server

```bash
# Start against the current repo
npm run cli -- mcp

# Start against a specific repo
npm run cli -- mcp --path /path/to/target-repo
```

### Copilot Chat Integration

Generate a VS Code / GitHub Copilot Chat workspace configuration:

```bash
npm run cli -- mcp config --path /path/to/target-repo
```

This writes `.vscode/mcp.json` with a `copilotArchitect` stdio server entry. It does **not** modify Copilot internals.

**To connect in VS Code:**

1. Open the target repository in VS Code.
2. Run `npm run cli -- mcp config`.
3. Open Command Palette → `MCP: List Servers`.
4. Start `copilotArchitect`.
5. Open GitHub Copilot Chat, switch to **Agent mode**, and enable the Copilot Architect tools when prompted.

## Tool Reference

All tools return structured JSON. Missing artifacts return a structured `{ ok: false, reason: "missing" }` response instead of throwing opaque errors.

### Read-Only Tools (Default)

| Tool | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `repo_map` | `startPath?` | Return the full `UniversalRepoMap` for the target repo, running analysis if no cached map exists |
| `workspace_map` | `startPath?` | Return the workspace-level map; generates per-repo maps and merges them |
| `detect_languages` | `startPath?` | Detected languages with confidence scores |
| `detect_frameworks` | `startPath?` | Detected frameworks |
| `detect_package_managers` | `startPath?` | Detected package managers |
| `detect_build_commands` | `startPath?` | Build commands from adapters and custom config |
| `detect_test_commands` | `startPath?` | Test commands from adapters and custom config |
| `search_repo` | `query`, `startPath?`, `limit?` | Keyword search the local index; auto-indexes if no index exists |
| `search_across_repos` | `query`, `startPath?`, `limit?` | Search across all workspace repos; results annotated with `repoName` and `repoRole` |
| `find_similar_feature` | `query`, `startPath?`, `limit?` | Search filtered to non-config source files most relevant to a feature description |
| `find_impacted_files` | `featureRequest`, `startPath?` | Return files likely affected by the described change |
| `analyze_impact` | `featureRequest`, `startPath?` | Return full impact analysis including affected languages, modules, and files |
| `analyze_cross_repo_impact` | `featureRequest`, `startPath?` | Cross-repo impact for multi-repo workspace configs; returns impacted repos and per-repo validation plans |
| `generate_plan_context` | `featureRequest`, `startPath?` | Return planning context (repo map + search results) without writing any artifacts |
| `get_validation_commands` | `startPath?` | List safe validation commands from detected and custom config |
| `get_safety_policy` | `startPath?` | Return the active safety policy; falls back to defaults if no `policy.json` exists |
| `get_latest_plan` | `startPath?` | Return the contents of `latest-plan.json`; `{ ok: false }` if none exists |
| `get_latest_validation` | `startPath?` | Return the contents of the latest validation report |
| `get_latest_review` | `startPath?` | Return the contents of the latest review report |
| `agent_status` | `startPath?` | Return installed agent status from `.github/agents/` |

### Approval-Gated Tools

| Tool | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_feature_plan` | `featureRequest`, `startPath?`, **`approved: true`** | Write plan artifacts (`latest-plan.json`, `latest-plan.md`) — requires `approved=true`; missing this argument returns an error |

---

## Design Rules

1. MCP tools call existing `packages/` service APIs — no separate business logic in `packages/mcp-server`.
2. Tools do not bypass the safety policy.
3. All tool responses are structured JSON.
4. Secrets are never returned in tool responses.
5. Missing artifacts return a graceful structured response, not a thrown error.
6. The `generate_feature_plan` tool is the only tool that writes artifacts, and it is gated behind an explicit `approved` flag.
7. Multi-repo workspace tools are aware of `.copilot-architect/workspace.json` and operate across all configured repos.

---

## Artifacts

MCP tools read and write the same `.copilot-architect/` artifacts as the CLI. This keeps local evidence portable between tools and agents:

- `repo-map.json` — read and written by `repo_map`
- `index/index.json` — read and written by `search_repo` (auto-indexes if missing)
- `plans/latest-plan.json` — written by `generate_feature_plan`, read by `get_latest_plan`
- `runs/latest-validation.json` — read by `get_latest_validation`
- `reviews/latest-review.json` — read by `get_latest_review`
- `policy.json` — read by `get_safety_policy`

---

## Example Usage in Copilot Chat

After starting the MCP server and connecting Copilot Chat, use the tools in Agent mode:

```text
@FeatureArchitect Use repo_map and search_repo to find patterns for invoice approval.
Then use generate_plan_context to build a detailed plan.
```

```text
@CodeReviewer Use get_latest_plan and get_latest_validation to review the implementation.
```
