## Phase 16 - Review Reports

Generate review reports from git diff, validation evidence, plan-vs-diff comparison, risk analysis, missing-test detection, and reviewer prompts.

Status: implemented as `ReviewService` with git diff reading, approved plan loading, optional validation report loading, expected-vs-actual file comparison, unexpected-change findings, missing-test detection, config/dependency/security/breaking-change signals, JSON/Markdown review artifacts, latest aliases, and a generated `@CodeReviewer` prompt.

## Phase 17 - VS Code Extension Shell

Add a basic VS Code extension shell with activity-bar entry, Copilot Architect webview, and commands for analyze, index, plan, validate, review, MCP startup, agent installation, and instruction generation.

Status: implemented as `packages/vscode-extension` with manifest contributions, activity-bar icon, webview dashboard sections, command registration, CLI delegation through `npm run cli -- ...`, MCP terminal/process startup, cross-platform npm executable handling, and smoke tests using a fake extension host.

## Phase 18 - Optional Local Web UI

Add a local-only browser UI for repo analysis, indexing, search, planning, artifact viewing, validation, review, workspace config, agent installation, instructions generation, and MCP start/stop.

Status: implemented as `packages/web` with a local Node HTTP server, compact browser UI, repo-map/latest-plan/latest-validation/latest-review/workspace/agent artifact display, CLI-delegated workflow actions, local MCP child-process management, `npm run cli -- serve` startup, host/port/path flags, and local-port smoke tests.

Support `.copilot-architect/workspace.json` with named repos, paths, and roles; add/list/remove repos; index and search across repos; analyze cross-repo impact; generate multi-repo plans and per-repo validation plans; and expose workspace map/search/impact through MCP.

Status: implemented with `WorkspaceService` config parsing and repo management, workspace-level repo-map generation, `IndexingService.indexWorkspace` and `searchWorkspace`, `WorkspacePlanningService` cross-repo impact and `multiRepo` plan augmentation, CLI `workspace list/remove` plus enhanced add/index/search/impact/plan/validate-plan behavior, and MCP `workspace_map`, `search_across_repos`, and `analyze_cross_repo_impact` tools.

## Phase 20 - Internal Team Controls

Add team-friendly setup scripts, local-first policy controls, command allow/block lists, required approval gates, telemetry disabled by default, artifact retention cleanup, secret redaction, admin-configurable agent template paths, trust metadata for generated files, and CLI `doctor`, `status`, `policy show`, `policy validate`, `audit list`, and `cleanup` coverage.

Status: implemented with expanded `.copilot-architect/policy.json` defaults and validation, `ArtifactCleanupService`, dry-run/apply cleanup CLI, enriched status and doctor output, redacted cleanup audit entries, generated trust metadata in agents/instructions/policy, policy-driven admin agent templates, and cross-platform setup/check-env scripts.

## Phase 21 - Advanced Intelligence Additions

Add local-first architecture pattern detection, dependency manifest detection, route/API detection, test relationship detection, risk scoring, plan quality scoring, and repo readiness diagnostics.

Status: implemented with `AdvancedAnalysisService`, CLI `diagnostics`, plan-embedded advanced analysis/risk scores/quality checks/readiness diagnostics, and tests covering React, Angular, Python, and Java sample repos.

## Phase 22 - Testing Matrix And Sample Repos

Create representative sample repos for React, Angular, Python, Java Maven, Java Gradle, Node API, polyglot monorepo, and generic fallback support. Add tests for adapter detection, repo discovery, indexing, search, planning, validation command detection, safety blocking, MCP, agents, instructions, handoff, review, workspace support, CLI commands, and the MVP e2e flow. Add CI coverage.

Status: implemented with the `samples/` matrix, `tests/sample-matrix.test.ts`, an end-to-end CLI flow from analyze through review, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Phase 23 - Packaging For Internal Sharing

Add clone-friendly install docs, npm link guidance, optional local tarball packaging, release artifacts, version command, changelog, troubleshooting guide, and upgrade guide for internal team distribution.

Status: implemented with `npm run cli -- version`, enhanced `doctor` packaging guidance, `npm run package:local`, `.npmignore`, `scripts/package-local.mjs`, root `CHANGELOG.md`, and internal installation, setup, troubleshooting, and upgrade docs.

## Phase 24 - MVP Definition And Lock

Lock the MVP boundary around the required TypeScript CLI, repo discovery, adapters, local indexing/search, planning, command config, validation, safety, MCP, agents, instructions, handoff, review, multi-repo basics, VS Code shell, and internal setup docs. Document explicit non-goals and require tests to keep proving the MVP path before new major scope is added.

Status: implemented in `docs/MVP_DEFINITION.md` with the exact required capability list, non-goals, MVP user path, lock rules, acceptance gates, and tests that enforce the documented boundary.

## Phase 25 - Development Governance

Add execution rules, PR guardrails, CI/release validation, and tests that keep MVP development disciplined.

Status: implemented with mandatory governance rules in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_EXECUTION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release-check.yml`, and governance tests that validate the artifacts.

## Phase 26 - End-To-End MVP Validation

Prove the locked MVP works across representative React, Angular, Python, Java, polyglot, MCP, agents/instructions, safety, and review workflows without adding major new scope.

Status: implemented with strict `--root` support for nested sample validation, clean-machine command detection fixes, `docs/PHASE_26_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`, and regression coverage in `tests/phase26-validation.test.ts`.

## Phase 27 - Developer Experience Polish

Improve internal usability through better CLI help, error messages, a one-command demo, a setup verification flow, cleaner doctor output, and a cleanup command for generated artifacts.

Status: implemented with:

- `npm run cli -- demo` — 4-step end-to-end demonstration (analyze → index → search → diagnostics) with actionable next steps and `--json` support.
- `doctor` now performs a real Node.js version check (≥ 20.11) and reports `status: "error"` with an upgrade link for unsupported runtimes, instead of always returning `"ok"`.
- Help text updated with a `Quick start: npm run cli -- demo` hint.
- All 7 agent templates corrected from fictional `gpt-5.2` to `gpt-4o`.
- Expanded secret redaction (AWS, GCP, Stripe, JWT, PEM, database connection strings, npm tokens, Slack tokens) in both `SecretRedactionService` and the policy default patterns.
- Extended safe executable set: `bun`, `deno`, `npx`, `tsc`, `biome`, `cargo`, `go`, `rustfmt`, `clippy`, `dotnet`, `mocha`, `jasmine`, `playwright`, `cypress`, `webpack`, `esbuild`, `turbo`, `nx`, `python3`, `uv`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `flake8`, `black`, `pipenv`.
- 6 new tests (147 total passing).
- Documentation updated: README, CHANGELOG, INSTALLATION, LANGUAGE_SUPPORT, SECURITY_MODEL, MCP_TOOLS, AGENT_WORKFLOWS, TROUBLESHOOTING, INTERNAL_TEAM_SETUP, UPGRADE_GUIDE.
